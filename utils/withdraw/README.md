## Auto withdraw script
This is a super naive script which withdraws and re-delegates your commission
and rewards. You can skip this routine and jump in only in case it failed -
you'll get a telegram notofication about that.

The script does pretty much the same as [auto-withdraw-delegate](https://github.com/Pretid/galactica_helpers/tree/main/auto-withdraw-delegate)
by [@Pretid](https://github.com/Pretid), however keeps your host machine a
bit more secure.
